# blocksapi-go
Client code for interacting with BlocksAPI from Go

---
**WARNING: this is not a final version of blocksapi-client. While API will remain backwards-compatible, it will be extended with service-discovery and advanced authorization. Thus, client library will also be extended to support those features. Furthermore, client library will further be improved with block decoding encapsulation and other things.**
